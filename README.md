# Handwritten Digit Recognition Project

## Summary

Handwritten digit recognition involves enabling machines to recognize human-written digits. This task is complex due to variations in handwriting. This project focuses on creating an automated system using Python to recognize handwritten digits. The system includes a GUI for digit prediction, which finds applications in ID recognition, vehicle number plate reading, and bank automation.

## Project Description

### Main Goals and Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a system for recognizing handwritten digits, enabling machines to easily interpret them. The project involves:
- Creating a GUI that allows users to draw and recognize digits in real time.
- Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python to classify handwritten digits into predefined classes (0-9).

### Objectives

The main objectives of this research are:
- Designing a deep learning-based model capable of recognizing digits from 0 to 9.
- Developing an appealing GUI that allows users to write digits for recognition and display.
